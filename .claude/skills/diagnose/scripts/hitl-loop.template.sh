# Human-in-the-loop reproduction loop.
# Copy this file, edit the steps below, and run it.
# The agent runs the script; the user follows prompts in their terminal.
#
# Usage:
#   bash hitl-loop.template.sh
#
# Two helpers:
#   step "<instruction>"       shows instruction, waits for Enter
#   capture VAR "<question>"   shows question, reads response into VAR
#
# Captured values are printed as KEY=VALUE at the end for the agent to parse.
